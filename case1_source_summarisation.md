## 🎓 Scenario
I uploaded a research paper titled **“Enhancing Customer Retention in the Telecom Industry with Machine Learning...”** into NotebookLM. My goal was to extract a high-level summary to use in a literature review.

## 🚀 Features Tested

### ✅ Auto-Summary
- NotebookLM created a concise summary highlighting:
  - Customer churn as a major problem
  - Use of ensemble algorithms (e.g., XGBoost)
  - The novel "Ratio-Based Data Balancing" method
- Bullet-point summaries were useful for writing topic overviews.

### ✅ Note Tagging
- I used manual note tagging to cluster key points like “Methodology” and “Findings”

### ✅ Reference Location
- The tool linked summary items to the original document sections

## 🧠 Reflection
NotebookLM helped me reduce hours of reading by pulling out core insights. However, it didn’t fully capture visual elements like graphs or detailed tables.
