# 📝 Case 1: Source-Based Summarisation

## 🎓 Scenario
I uploaded a research paper titled **“Enhancing Customer Retention in the Telecom Industry with Machine Learning...”** into NotebookLM. My goal was to extract a high-level summary to use in a literature review.

## 🚀 Features Tested

### ✅ Auto-Summary
- NotebookLM created a concise summary highlighting:
  - Customer churn as a major problem
  - Use of ensemble algorithms (e.g., XGBoost)
  - The novel "Ratio-Based Data Balancing" method
- Bullet-point summaries were useful for writing topic overviews.

### ✅ Note Tagging
- I used manual note tagging to cluster key points like “Methodology” and “Findings”

### ✅ Reference Location
- The tool linked summary items to the original document sections

---

## 🧠 Reflection
NotebookLM helped me reduce hours of reading by pulling out core insights. However, it didn’t fully capture visual elements like graphs or detailed tables.

## 📊 Critical Evaluation

### ✅ Accuracy and Relevance of the AI-Generated Output
The summary was accurate and aligned well with the original research. It included key themes such as:
- The role of machine learning in churn reduction
- Data imbalance and its resolution
- Performance comparisons among algorithms

There were no hallucinations or incorrect claims, but the summary lacked direct citations or critical interpretation.

### 🎓 Usefulness in Academic Workflows
Highly valuable for:
- Summarising long research articles quickly
- Drafting the beginning of literature reviews
- Identifying main ideas for future reading

Especially useful for postgraduates juggling multiple readings.

### ⚠ Limitations and Concerns
- The summary was descriptive rather than analytical
- No academic citation or page numbers were provided
- It overlooked complex figures, tables, and data visualisations
- Users still need to read the full document for a complete understanding

## ✅ Summary
NotebookLM’s Source-Based Summarisation was a time-saving tool for digesting academic research. It efficiently highlighted key concepts, but students should verify information and supplement it with their own critique and references when writing assignments.
