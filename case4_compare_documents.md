# 🔍 Case 4: Comparing and Contrasting Multiple Documents

## Scenario
I uploaded two research papers related to customer churn in telecom and wanted to compare their:
- Algorithms used
- Accuracy results
- Preprocessing methods

## Features Tested

### ✅ Multi-Document Analysis
- NotebookLM allowed browsing both papers side-by-side
- I asked: *“Which paper uses XGBoost?”* and *“Which one focuses more on data balancing?”*

### ✅ Q&A Across Documents
- It correctly identified which document mentioned each technique

### ✅ Note Sections per Document
- Created separate notes for Paper 1 and Paper 2 under separate headings

## Reflection
This feature is helpful for literature comparisons. However, it doesn’t “synthesize” multiple sources into one summary — it keeps them separate.
