# 📚 Case 3: Automatically Created Study Guide

## 🎓 Scenario
A postgraduate student is preparing for the final exam in a Predictive Analytics course. To consolidate their learning, the student uploads lecture notes from all weeks into NotebookLM. After uploading, the student uses the **Study Guide** function to auto-generate structured content for revision.

NotebookLM produces a comprehensive study guide that includes:
- Summarised key topics (e.g., Predictive Analytics Life Cycle, Model Evaluation, Churn Prediction)
- Glossary of important terms (e.g., precision, recall, lift, F1-score)
- Multiple-choice style quiz questions
- Suggested essay prompts to support deeper reflection

---

## 🚀 Features Demonstrated

### ✅ Auto-Generated Notes
NotebookLM automatically grouped content by topic and summarised core concepts from the uploaded lectures. This helped identify:
- Major learning outcomes from each week
- Links between different lecture topics
- High-impact terms and models

### ✅ Export to Google Docs
The generated study guide was exported to Google Docs for further editing and annotation. This made it easy to:
- Add diagrams and formulas manually
- Share notes with peers in a study group
- Integrate personal examples for better understanding

### ✅ Glossary and Prompt Generation
NotebookLM included a glossary with clear, concise definitions of technical terms and key metrics. It also suggested:
- Review questions to self-test understanding
- Essay prompts based on real-world applications of predictive analytics

## ✅ Summary
NotebookLM’s Study Guide feature provided a practical way to organise and revise Predictive Analytics material. While not a replacement for hands-on problem-solving or in-class discussions, it worked well as a supplement for structured revision and self-assessment.
