# ðŸ“š Case 3: Automatically Created Study Guide

## ðŸŽ“ Scenario
A postgraduate student is preparing for the final exam in a Predictive Analytics course. To consolidate their learning, the student uploads lecture notes from all weeks into NotebookLM. After uploading, the student uses the **Study Guide** function to auto-generate structured content for revision.

NotebookLM produces a comprehensive study guide that includes:
- Summarised key topics (e.g., Predictive Analytics Life Cycle, Model Evaluation, Churn Prediction)
- Glossary of important terms (e.g., precision, recall, lift, F1-score)
- Multiple-choice style quiz questions
- Suggested essay prompts to support deeper reflection

## ðŸš€ Features Demonstrated

### âœ… Auto-Generated Notes
NotebookLM automatically grouped content by topic and summarised core concepts from the uploaded lectures. This helped identify:
- Major learning outcomes from each week
- Links between different lecture topics
- High-impact terms and models

### âœ… Export to Google Docs
The generated study guide was exported to Google Docs for further editing and annotation. This made it easy to:
- Add diagrams and formulas manually
- Share notes with peers in a study group
- Integrate personal examples for better understanding

### âœ… Glossary and Prompt Generation
NotebookLM included a glossary with clear, concise definitions of technical terms and key metrics. It also suggested:
- Review questions to self-test understanding
- Essay prompts based on real-world applications of predictive analytics

## ðŸ§  Critical Evaluation

### âœ… Accuracy and Relevance of the AI-Generated Output
The study guide content was clear and aligned with the lecture materials. Key terms were defined correctly, and the generated questions were appropriate for postgraduate-level learning. All content was relevant and free of hallucinations.

### ðŸŽ“ Usefulness in Academic Workflows
This feature significantly supported exam revision and independent learning by:
- Breaking down dense lecture slides into digestible points
- Offering multiple learning formats (summaries, glossary, questions)
- Promoting active recall and deeper thinking

### âš  Limitations and Concerns
- The guide wasnâ€™t tailored to specific weeks or the exact course outline
- Some questions were generic and could benefit from more context or examples
- Diagram-heavy or formula-based content was not well represented

## âœ… Summary
NotebookLMâ€™s Study Guide feature provided a practical way to organise and revise Predictive Analytics material. While not a replacement for hands-on problem-solving or in-class discussions, it worked well as a supplement for structured revision and self-assessment.
